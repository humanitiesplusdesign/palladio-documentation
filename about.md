Palladio is a toolset for easy upload and careful investigation of data. It is an intertwined set of visualizations designed for complex, multi-dimensional data. It is a product of the ["Networks in History" project](/projects/networks-in-history) that has its roots in another humanities research project based at Stanford: [*Mapping the Republic of Letters*](http://republicofletters.stanford.edu) (MRofL). MRofL produced a number of unique visualizations tied to individual case studies and specific research questions. You can see [the tools](/tools/) on this site and read about the case studies at [republicofletters.stanford.edu](http://republicofletters.stanford.edu).

With "Networks in History" we are taking the insights gained and lessons learned from MRofL and applying them to a set of visualizations that reflect humanistic thinking about data. Palladio is our first step toward opening data visualization to any researcher by making it possible to upload data and visualize within the browser without any barriers. **There is no need to create an account and we do not store the data.** On the visualization side, we have emphasized tools for filtering. There is a timeline filter that allows for filtering on discontinuous time periods. There is a facet filter based on Moritz Stefaner's Elastic Lists that is particularly useful when exploring multidimensional data sets.

Palladio is made possible by support from the  Office of Digital Humanities within the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Vice Provost for Online Education at Stanford, the Wallenberg Foundation, the Stanford University Libraries, and the Dean of Research at Stanford.
