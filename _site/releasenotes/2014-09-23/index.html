<hr />

<p>The 0.7.0 release of Palladio features an interface for querying SPARQL endpoints, as well as several bug fixes and enhancements, most specifically pertaining to the TimeLine and TimeSpan tools.</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<p><strong>SPARQL Support</strong></p>

<p>Palladio now offers SPARQL support, allowing the use of a SPARQL query to load data from a publicly available SPARQL endpoint. An incomplete list of SPARQL endpoints is available <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/SparqlEndpoints">here</a>.
SPARQL loading capability is available on the initial data load as well as in the context of extending tables.</p>

<h2 id="bug-fixes-and-enhancements">Bug Fixes and Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>TimeSpan filter allows use of dimensions in any order (previously, the first dimension was required to have dates that always preceded the dates in the second dimension).</li>
  <li>TimeLine filter now displays the current filter on the large timeline.</li>
  <li>Initial data loading page now provides all loading options in a consistent tabbed interface.</li>
  <li>Palladio no longer automatically adds ‘&amp;output=csv’ to Google spreadsheets links, allowing for the loading of any CSV that is available on a server that allows cross-site loading.</li>
</ul>
