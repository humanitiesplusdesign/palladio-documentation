<h2 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Major performance fix to data load/processing.</li>
  <li>Filters applied on facet filter dimensions don’t go away when the facet filter is removed (thanks to Christoph Kudella for the bug report).</li>
  <li>Application was non-functional after refreshing while in the visualization view. Now fixed.</li>
  <li>Changing table and dimension names in the data view did not update in the visualization view (thank you, again, Christoph!). Fixed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New Filter View Modes. We are refining and re-working the filter components (timeline and facet-filter) so that each has three view modes: small, medium, large. The ‘large’ view is comparable to one of the primary data views (map, graph, table, gallery) in that it functions as a display that can be filtered by time or facet.</li>
  <li>Timeline Filter. The double-decker timeline is gone. The timeline filter is streamlined and elegant.</li>
  <li>Timespan Filter. Now displays records that only have a start date or an end date as points.</li>
  <li>Map Layers. Drag to order layers.</li>
  <li>Map Layers. Sort order is reversed so that top layer is at the top of the list.</li>
  <li>Facet filter. Indicates number of values in each facet.</li>
  <li>Facet filter. Small bottom margin.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Expanded Timespan View.</li>
  <li>Timespan tooltips.</li>
  <li>Y-Axis Grouping.</li>
  <li>Duration view.</li>

  <li>Multi-file support. One Palladio instance can host and load multiple save files based on the URL</li>
</ul>
