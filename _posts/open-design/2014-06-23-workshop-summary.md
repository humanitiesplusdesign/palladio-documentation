Throughout the Palladio design process we have elicited detailed feedback from several researchers (**Open Design Contributors**), and have kept a record of their comments and suggestions, many of which have been (or will be) incorporated into our new versions of the platform.

We invited our **Open Design Contributors** to a two-day workshop (May 15-16) at Stanford, to discuss the development and uses of Palladio and to consider the future potential of data visualization for scholars. 

The first day of discussion was dedicated to the feedback provided by our core group of **Open Design Contributors**, each of whom was invited to deliver a short presentation drawing on their experiences with Palladio and their thoughts for the future of the platform. The second day of the workshop involved the Humanities + Design team presenting on Palladio’s design and development process and on upcoming data visualization projects. 

During both days we engaged in more general discussion about ways to think about place/space and mapping social networks, as well as working with ambiguous dates in our data and visualizations. We also touched specifically on aspects of the logistics of research and publication within the Digital Humanities.

###A Summary of Open Design Contributor Workshop Presentations: 

**Jo Guldi,** Assistant Professor of History at Brown University, spoke about the analytic and rhetorical functions of Palladio, asking “What do historians see when they close their eyes?” and “What will this tool be used for?” Her talk privileged Palladio’s node/link graph view and the ways it helped her think synthetically about her research into land reform. She spoke of the creative work of the historian trying to make sense of categories and she proposed that we think of visualizations as provocations. 

**Howard Hotson,** Professor of Early Modern Intellectual History at Oxford, based at St Anne’s College, spoke about the potential for integration between the Early Modern Letters Online project and Palladio. Hotson also shed much light into the institutional logistics of launching and maintaining such large-scale digital projects.

**Eero Hyvönen,** Research Director and Professor, working in the Semantic Computing Research Group at the Department of Media Technology at Aalto University and in the Department of Computer Science at University of Helsinki, offered many insights into linked data and advice for improving the tool’s user experience and interface, as well as back end processing functions.  Hyvönen’s talk was titled “Experimenting with Palladio and National Semantic Biography.”

**Christoph Kudella,** doctoral candidate at University College Cork, participating in their Digital Arts and Humanities program, spoke about using Palladio as an exploratory tool to hypothesize and analyze possible relationships that people might have had, rather than the more conventional uses of visualizing more clearly extant relationships. He spoke also about using Palladio with his students, working on German history and prosopography. 

**Peter N. Miller,** Dean and Professor at Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture, challenged the group to think about the limitations of Palladio and of thinking visually (rather than textually or verbally). He asked how Palladio might be developed to address the problem of single historical actors and small datasets.

**Adam T. Rabinowitz,** Assistant Professor in the Department of Classics and Assistant Director of the Institute of Classical Archaeology, at the University of Texas at Austin, focused on Palladio’s uses as a teaching tool and provided background into how he used the platform to have students think about different ways of approaching and representing narratives of the ancient world. His talk was titled "Palladio and pedagogy: testing the platform for the visualization of Herodotus' Histories in an undergraduate classroom"

**Corey Tazzara,** Assistant Professor of History at Scripps College, spoke about the benefits of using Palladio for public presentations in conjunction with his project on the free port of Livorno. He also discussed the potential to use Palladio to help him visualize the distribution of customs fraud in free ports, as well as the paths of goods being imported and exported. Tazzara’s talk was titled “Thoughts on Palladio: Mapping Free Ports.”

**Thomas Wallnig,** Project Leader of the START project “Monastic Enlightenment and the Benedictine Republic of Letters” at the Institute of History of the University of Vienna and the Austrian Institute of Historical Research, spoke about the scholarly concerns of mapping and graphing social relationships. He wondered about how best to represent the complex relations between places and institution, for example the many iterations of Vienna (as city, university, legal entity, archbishopric, imperial court…). Wallnig’s talk was titled “"Questions arising from applying Palladio to the visualization of the correspondence of the brothers Pez OSB; with reference to the experiences made by Christian Gastgeber (National Library, Vienna) while visualizing the Lambeck Correspondence."
